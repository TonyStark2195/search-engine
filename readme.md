Description:    A simple general recommendation engine that can be used in multiple applications.
Concepts:       Simple basic algorithms, ML based algorithms, 
Technology:     All things in pipeline uses Python. Web crawler for pulling data from the internet, Elastic Search for storing data, Search
                Engine for searching through data, Deep Learning (both vision and language), traditional algorithms, graph based algorithms,
                web framework for publishing and visualizing as an application, build an api.
Intent of this project is to learn as much technology as possible and apply it in real case scenario.
